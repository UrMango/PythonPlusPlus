# PythonPlusPlus
A Python interpreter written in C++

# Welcome to Python++

Python++ is a Python interpreter written in C++.

## Getting Started

To use Python++, you will need a C++ compiler and the following dependencies:

- `Type.h`
- `InterpreterException.h`
- `Parser.h`

You can then compile the Python++ interpreter by running the following command:
```bash
  g++ main.cpp -o python++
  ./python++
```

You can also open it in a Visual Studio project and run it from there.

## Features

Python++ supports the following features:

- Basic Python syntax, including variables, operators, and control structures
- Input and output using the `print()` function
- Exception handling using try-except blocks

## Limitations

Python++ is a basic interpreter and does not support all features of the Python language. Some notable limitations include:

- No support for modules or import statements
- Limited support for data types, including no support for lists or dictionaries
- No support for object-oriented programming
